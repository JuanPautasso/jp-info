    When listed first as the primary author, I conducted the majority of the tasks, including image processing, measurements, data analysis, image acquisition, image simulation, dose calculations, and experiment design, with valuable input and collaboration from co-authors. For articles where I am not listed first, I contributed in secondary roles, providing support in specific areas such as image acquisition, dose calculation, or data analysis, while the majority of the workload was carried out by other authors.
