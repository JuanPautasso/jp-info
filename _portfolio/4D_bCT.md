### Overview
This project evaluates the quantitative accuracy of dynamic iodine concentration imaging in 4D Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Breast CT (4D DCE-bCT) for enhanced breast tumor monitoring. The work includes system adaptations, phantom experiments, and advanced reconstruction techniques to validate iodine concentration measurements.

### Key Features
- Developed a dedicated breast CT system for extended acquisitions with optimized x-ray spectra.
- Designed a breast perfusion phantom to simulate time-varying iodine concentrations (range: 0.5–10 mg I/mL).
- Used Monte Carlo simulations for scatter correction and advanced reconstruction algorithms (IMPACT and PICCS).

### Results
- Quantitative accuracy:
  - Wash-in: Slope = 0.7530, Offset = +0.5208, R² = 0.985.
  - Wash-out: Slope = 1.012, Offset = -0.8295, R² = 0.987.
- Bland-Altman analysis showed deviations within acceptable limits (±1 mg I/mL).
- Improved perfusion curve accuracy for iodine quantification during dynamic imaging.

### Clinical Significance
This study highlights the potential of 4D DCE-bCT for dynamic imaging of breast tumors, enabling precise iodine quantification and supporting clinical decision-making for treatment monitoring and evaluation.
