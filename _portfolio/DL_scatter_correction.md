### Overview
This project focuses on developing a deep learning (DL) model to correct x-ray scatter in breast computed tomography (bCT) images. The goal is to improve image quality by enhancing contrast and correcting artifacts, ultimately supporting quantitative reconstructions for clinical applications.

### Key Features
- Utilized U-Net architecture for scatter correction.
- Generated training data using Monte Carlo simulations.
- Improved contrast by a mean of 25% and reduced cupping artifacts.
- Achieved near real-time scatter correction (~0.2s per projection).
- Validated results with structural similarity (SSIM) of 0.99.

### Technical Highlights
1. **Data Generation**:
   - Segmented patient scans into breast tissue types: skin, adipose, fibroglandular.
   - Augmented phantoms with translations to create robust training datasets.
   - Simulated primary and scatter projection images using Monte Carlo algorithms.

2. **Model Development**:
   - Designed a U-Net model to estimate scatter signal.
   - Incorporated breast thickness maps and positional data as additional inputs.
   - Trained on 110 phantoms, validated internally, and tested externally.

defined as the main input, while the respective thickness maps and the breast center of mass distance were included at the network bottleneck" />

3. **Validation & Testing**:
   - Internal Validation: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.94%.
   - External Testing: MAE of 2.84% and structural similarity of 0.99.
   - Clinical Evaluation: Improved contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and reduced artifacts.

### Clinical Significance
The scatter-corrected images enhanced visual interpretation, improved contrast by a mean of 25%, and significantly reduced artifacts. These results demonstrate the feasibility of integrating this model into daily clinical workflows.
