### Overview
This project implemented a parallel-cascaded model to optimize the imaging performance of a dedicated breast CT (bCT) system for contrast-enhanced imaging. The model characterizes the systemâ€™s spatial resolution, noise, and iodine detectability to identify optimal acquisition parameters for 4D dynamic contrast-enhanced bCT.

### Key Features
- **System Validation:** Model predictions for MTF and NPS were validated against measured data, achieving errors below 5% for MTF at 49 kV and 65 kV.
- **Spectral Optimization:** Using a task-based detectability index, a 0.25 mm copper filter at 65 kV was identified as optimal for iodine detection, outperforming default aluminum filtration by up to 90%.
- **Clinical Relevance:** Enhanced contrast-to-noise ratios, supporting improved lesion detectability in clinical practice.

### Significance
This work provides a foundation for advancing 4D dynamic contrast-enhanced bCT by ensuring high-quality input data for image reconstruction and improving the diagnostic capabilities of breast imaging systems.
