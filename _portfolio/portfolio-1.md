A preprocessing and processing pipeline for R-fMRI data was developed, tailored to research needs with input from professionals at Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón. The pipeline integrates the strengths of various open-source fMRI software tools and was successfully implemented and tested.

Key achievements include:

Accurate cortical surface extraction and successful structural-functional image registration.
Automated execution from a terminal or executable file, allowing analysis of multiple patients with results organized for easy access.
Compatibility with both personal computers and clusters, requiring only standard hardware (e.g., 8GB RAM, i5 processor).
Processing time reduced to approximately 50 minutes per patient, compared to a full day when done manually.
Standardized processing for all patients with flexibility to replace individual software functions easily.
The pipeline efficiently analyzed a study sample of 59 patients (healthy controls and mild cognitive impairment) in 3 days, identifying connectivity differences between the left hippocampus and right medial prefrontal cortex. Results demonstrated the pipeline's reliability and its integration with Python for statistical analyses.

This multidisciplinary project combines mathematics, statistics, programming, machine learning, and medical imaging. It highlights the benefits of collaboration in research, reducing workload and costs while accelerating results, thus advancing patient care and scientific understanding.
