The developed pipeline automates preprocessing and processing of R-fMRI data to analyze functional connectivity, particularly in the Default Mode Network (DMN). Key outcomes include:

- Functional connectivity differences between control subjects (27) and patients with mild cognitive impairment (32) were identified, specifically reduced connectivity between the left hippocampus and right medial prefrontal cortex.
- Statistical analyses, accounting for age and gender, confirmed significant differences (p < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction).
- The pipeline enables efficient data analysis with results generated in approximately 50 minutes per subject, a significant improvement over manual methods.
- The tool is flexible, standardized, and accessible on conventional hardware, promoting widespread usability and reducing workload and costs for researchers and clinicians."

A preprocessing and processing pipeline for R-fMRI data was developed, tailored to research needs with input from professionals at Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón. The pipeline integrates the strengths of various open-source fMRI software tools and was successfully implemented and tested.

Key achievements include:

- Accurate cortical surface extraction and successful structural-functional image registration.
- Automated execution from a terminal or executable file, allowing analysis of multiple patients with results organized for easy access.
- Compatibility with both personal computers and clusters, requiring only standard hardware (e.g., 8GB RAM, i5 processor).
- Processing time reduced to approximately 50 minutes per patient, compared to a full day when done manually.
- Standardized processing for all patients with flexibility to replace individual software functions easily.
- The pipeline efficiently analyzed a study sample of 59 patients (healthy controls and mild cognitive impairment) in 3 days, identifying connectivity differences between the left hippocampus and right medial prefrontal cortex. Results demonstrated the pipeline's reliability and its integration with Python for statistical analyses.

This multidisciplinary project combines mathematics, statistics, programming, machine learning, and medical imaging. It highlights the benefits of collaboration in research, reducing workload and costs while accelerating results, thus advancing patient care and scientific understanding.
