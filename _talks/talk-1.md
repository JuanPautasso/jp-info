This presentation highlights the development and evaluation of a 4D Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Breast CT (4D DCE-bCT) system, emphasizing its ability to achieve precise iodine quantification for monitoring breast tumor perfusion. By integrating optimized x-ray spectra, advanced reconstruction algorithms, and dynamic imaging techniques, the system accurately captured wash-in and wash-out phases of iodine, showcasing its potential for improved breast cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. Quantitative accuracy was validated with phantom experiments, achieving strong linear correlations and minimal deviations in iodine concentration measurements. This work underscores the clinical utility of 4D DCE-bCT in advancing breast imaging and enhancing patient care through reliable and dynamic tumor monitoring.

The talk was presented at the 17th International Workshop on Breast Imaging (IWBI‐2024), held June 9–12, 2024, in Chicago, IL, USA, and hosted by the University of Chicago.
