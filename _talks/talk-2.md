This presentation evaluates the imaging performance and dosimetric efficiency of second-generation (GEN2) compared to first-generation (GEN1) dedicated breast CT systems.

By analyzing key metrics such as modulation transfer function, noise power spectrum, detective quantum efficiency, and mean glandular dose, GEN2 demonstrated significant improvements. GEN2 provided better resolution for calcifications, higher DQE across frequencies, and consistently lower MGD for varying breast sizes, enhancing clinical performance. However, GEN1 outperformed GEN2 in contrast-to-noise ratio and signal-to-noise ratio for larger masses, highlighting its strength in specific applications.

The talk was presented at the International Workshop of Breast Imaging 2022, held in Leuven, Belgium.
