This presentation highlights the development and validation of a Parallel-Cascaded Model (PCM) for optimizing dedicated breast CT systems. The model simulates key image quality metrics, including modulation transfer function and normalized noise power spectrum, to guide system optimization and enhance performance for clinical imaging tasks.

This work demonstrates the PCMâ€™s ability to accurately predict imaging performance, supporting the development of advanced imaging techniques.

The talk was presented at the European Congress of Radiology 2023, held in Vienna, Austria.
