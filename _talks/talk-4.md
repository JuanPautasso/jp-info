This presentation describes the development and validation of a deep learning (DL) model for predicting and correcting x-ray scatter in breast CT images. The model was trained using Monte Carlo simulated projections and augmented breast phantoms, achieving accurate scatter prediction and significant improvements in imaging quality.

This study demonstrates the potential of DL-based scatter correction to enhance image quality in breast CT imaging, supporting better diagnostic accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. The findings are particularly relevant for improving contrast and artifact correction in clinical practice.

The talk was presented at the European Congress of Radiology 2022, held in Vienna, Austria.
