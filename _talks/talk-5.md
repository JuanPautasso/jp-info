This presentation describes the development and validation of a deep learning (DL) model for predicting and correcting x-ray scatter in breast CT images. 
This study demonstrates, initially, the potential of DL-based scatter correction to enhance image quality in breast CT imaging.

The talk was presented at the American Association of Physicists in Medicine 2021, 63rd Annual Meeting and Exhibition held in Los Angeles, United States.
