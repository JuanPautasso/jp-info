This presentation focuses on the optimization of acquisition techniques for dual-energy contrast-enhanced breast CT to improve tissue differentiation and quantitative imaging. 

This study lays the groundwork for developing a breast imaging modality capable of providing quantitative and functional information.

The talk was presented at the European Congress of Medical Physics 2020, held in Turin, Italy.
