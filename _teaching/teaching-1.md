## Lecture: Non-Traditional Interfaces and Electromyography

### Learning Objectives
1. Explain the concept of non-traditional interfaces and their relevance in human-computer interaction.
2. Define electromyography (EMG) and describe its use in detecting and interpreting muscle activity.
3. Discuss the applications of EMG in non-traditional interfaces, including gesture recognition and prosthetics.

## Practicum: Implementing and Analyzing Non-Traditional Interfaces with EMG

### Learning Objectives
1. Compare traditional and non-traditional interface designs, highlighting the role of EMG.
2. Acquire and process EMG signals to analyze muscle activity in different scenarios.
3. Evaluate the impact of signal processing techniques on EMG-based interface performance.
4. Explore the practical challenges of using EMG in real-world applications, including noise, electrode placement, and user variability.

## Hands-On Activities
- **Signal Acquisition**: Use EMG devices to collect data from muscle activity during specific tasks.
- **Signal Processing**: Apply filtering techniques to clean EMG signals and analyze patterns.
- **Interface Design**: Prototype a simple interface (e.g., gesture-controlled device) using EMG signals.
