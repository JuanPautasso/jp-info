## Lecture: Fundamentals of Image Quality in X-Ray Imaging Systems

### Learning Objectives
1. **Understand Image Quality Descriptors**: Define and explain the basic descriptors of image quality, including:
   - **Contrast**: Differentiating between varying intensities in an image.
   - **Spatial Resolution**: The ability to distinguish fine details in an image.
   - **Noise**: The presence of random variations in image intensity.
   
2. **Identify Acquisition Parameters**: List and describe the main acquisition parameters in x-ray imaging systems, such as:
   - **Exposure**: The total energy delivered to the imaging system.
   - **Tube Voltage (kVp)**: Its role in image quality and dose.
   - **Geometric Considerations**: Factors like source-to-detector distance, beam collimation, and object positioning.

3. **Analyze the Impact of Parameters on Image Quality**: Briefly describe how varying acquisition parameters affect the image quality descriptors (contrast, spatial resolution, and noise) and the resulting clinical outcomes.

## Practicum: Image Acquisition and Image Quality Optimization

### Learning Objectives
1. **Compare Imaging Modalities**:
   - Identify and describe the key differences between **Mammography/DBT (Digital Breast Tomosynthesis)** acquisitions and **Breast CT** acquisitions, including technical and clinical applications.

2. **Analyze Image Quality**:
   - Evaluate images to understand how acquisition parameters influence image quality, focusing on:
     - **Contrast**: How acquisition settings impact differentiation.
     - **Spatial Resolution**: How details are affected by system adjustments.
     - **Noise**: Its variations based on acquisition techniques.

3. **Understand Dose Management**:
   - Explain how changes in acquisition parameters and imaging conditions affect the radiation dose delivered to the patient.
   - Discuss the **“ALARA” concept** ("As Low As Reasonably Achievable") and its importance in minimizing patient radiation exposure while maintaining diagnostic image quality.

### Suggested Activities
- **Practical Demonstrations**: Conduct live image acquisitions on x-ray imaging systems with varying parameters to observe their impact on image quality descriptors.
- **Image Analysis Exercises**: Provide a set of mammography, DBT, and breast CT images for participants to analyze and compare.
- **Dose Optimization Workshop**: Simulate scenarios to adjust acquisition parameters while balancing image quality and dose.
