# Lecture: Image quality and intro to practicum
# ======

# Learning Objectives
1. 	Explain the basic image quality descriptors: contrast, spatial resolution, and noise.
2. 	List the main acquisition parameters in x-ray imaging systems (exposure, tube voltage, geometric considerations).
3. 	Briefly describe how acquisition parameters affect image quality.

# Practicum: Image acquisition and image quality

Learning Objectives
1. 	Describe the key differences between Mammography/DBT acquisitions and breast CT acquisitions.
2. 	Analyze images and describe how acquisition parameters affect image quality in terms of contrast, spatial resolution and noise.
3. 	Identify how changing acquisition parameters and conditions affects the dose. Explain the “ALARA” concept.
